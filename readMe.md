# DSA Exercises

- **Question 1:** Create two integer arrays A and B. The two arrays must contain at least 256 elements but must be of unequal size. Populate both arrays with randomly generated integers between 0 and 1024. Sort array A using Shell Sort and array B using Quick Sort
- **Question 2:** Take the two sorted arrays A and B from the question above and merge into a new array C. You must do this in linear time. Note that the size of C must be size of A plus size of B.
- **Question 3:** Let A be an array of n elements (that is, the elements of A are A[0], . . . ,A[n−1]). An element A[i] is extreme if the following conditions hold regarding A[i]
    - A[i] is not the first nor the last element of A. That is, 0 < i < n – 1 and either A[i − 1] < A[i] > A[i + 1] or A[i − 1] > A[i] < A[i + 1]. For example, the extreme points of an array [0, 5, 3, 6, 8, 7, 15, 9] are 5, 3, 8, 7, 15.

    Write an algorithm that prints the extreme points of the given array. If there are no extreme points, the algorithm prints “SORTED”.
- **Question 4:** Write a program that, given a list of integers, finds all 2-pairs of integers that have the same product. A 2-pair is 2 distinct pairs of integers ((a,b),(c,d)) where a X b = c X d and a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ d. The range of integers in the list should be from 1 to 1024
- **Question 5:** Write a program that uses an ADT Stack to evaluate arithmetic expressions in RPN format. The contents of the stack should be displayed on the screen during evaluation. The allowed arithmetic operators are +, -, x, and /
- **Question 6:** Write a Boolean function that checks if a number is prime. Also implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
- **Question 7:** Write a program that accepts as input a sequence of integers (one by one) and then incrementally builds, and displays, a Binary Search Tree (BST). There is no need to balance the BST.
- **Question 8:** Write a program that finds an approximation to the square root of a given number n using an iterative numerical method such as the NewtonRaphson Method.
- **Question 9:** Write a program that, given an array of integers, finds all integers in the array that are repeated more than once. Try to find the fastest and most memory-efficient way of doing this
- **Question 10:** Write a recursive function that finds the largest number in a given list of integers
- **Question 11:** Write a function that computes cosine or sine by taking the first n terms of the appropriate series expansion.
- **Question 12:** Write a function that returns the sum of the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (Wikipedia). The first 2 numbers in the sequence are 1,1,…
